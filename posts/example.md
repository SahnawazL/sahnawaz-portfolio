title: "Welcome to My Blog"

Hey â€” I'm **Sahnawaz Ahmed Laskar**.

This little corner of my portfolio is where I write short, practical notes about the work I actually do.  
You'll find concise, human-first write-ups â€” not long tutorials or AI-generated fluff â€” about things like:

- Real project work (Iâ€™ve contributed to parts of projects for **Flipkart**, **Xiaomi**, and **Rapido**)
- How I solved specific front-end problems (performance, responsive UX, animations)
- Architecture notes (PWA, service workers, offline fallbacks)
- Builds & automation (GitHub Actions I use to publish this site)
- Small experiments (Chart.js visualizations, terminal-style UI, audio cues)
- Quick design decisions (why I chose a layout, color, or interaction)

### How this blog works
- Posts are written in **Markdown** (like this file).  
- The site automatically converts them to HTML using my custom GitHub Action.  
- If I donâ€™t specify a `date`, the build system sets the publish date automatically.
